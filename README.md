# View-Property-App
An android app that allows users to select a type of property (Apartment, Condomium, Town House etc.) and view properties and addresses. Users can then select the property and add it to a view list. The selected properties will show up in the checkout screen where the user can select one of the properties and a payment method (Cash, Debit, Credit). If the user selects Debit or Credit, they will be asked to enter their card details after which the payment successful screen will be displayed.
